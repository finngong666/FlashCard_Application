Is there a way to convert primitive data types to objects in Java?= Yes, there is a way to convert primitive data types to objects in Java. We can do so by using the Wrapper class. The Wrapper class in Java is used for interconversion between objects and primitive data types. For example, int is converted to Integer, char to Character, byte to Byte, and so on. These are 8 wrapper classes in total.
Does Java support pointers?= Java does not support pointers. Pointers are used to directly point a location in memory. This will pose a threat to security of Java and compromise its purpose. As we know that Java uses the concepts of OOP, it is already complex. Hence to make it less complex and remove ambiguity, pointers are not allowed in Java.
Are Java strings mutable?= No, java strings are not mutable. String objects in Java are immutable by nature, which basically implies that once a string object has been created, its state cannot be changed in any way. Java creates a new string object whenever you attempt to edit the value of that object rather than modifying the values of that particular object.
What do you know about garbage collection?= Garbage collection is an interesting feature of Java. In simple words, unreferenced objects are garbage in Java. Unused runtime memory is automatically recollected by Garbage Collection. Also, it is a method of destroying useless objects. Java garbage collection automates memory management in Java applications.
What is an interface?=  To put it another way. an interface is in Java what you might refer to as the blueprint of a class, or as a collection of abstract methods and constants. Each method in an interface is public and abstract, but it lacks a constructor. This means that in its most basic form, an interface is nothing more than a collection of undefined methods. Only method signatures and constant declarations are allowed in interfaces. Interfaces are specified with the interface keyword.
The term "instance variable" is another name for?= non-static field - instance variables are specific to an object
The term "class variable" is another name for?= static field - class variables are fixed and global across all instances of the class
A local variable stores temporary state; it is declared inside a ___?= method
An ___ is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.= array
Common behavior can be defined in a ___ and inherited into a ___ using the ___ keyword.= superclass, subclass, extends
